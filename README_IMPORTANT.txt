1)  The raster data was too big, I couldn't upload it GitHub, so click the link and download the X2015_final_1km     please.
Please download it to Data folder and do not change the name.


2) Most codes is inside the Chunks, but for plotting codes I wrote without chunks for looking in plots section (on the right side).

3) For Report file, open and click the "visual" not "source".
